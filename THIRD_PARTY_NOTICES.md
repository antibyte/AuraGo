# Third-party notices

AuraGo links the listed Go modules or retrieves the listed optional model/runtime artifacts. When `embeddings.provider` is `local-granite`, native runtimes and model weights are downloaded on demand and verified by exact size and SHA-256 rather than embedded in the primary binary.

## Humanizer writing guidance

The Writer specialist's compact additional prompt in `internal/config/config.go`
and `config_template.yaml` adapts concepts from
[Humanizer 3.0.0](https://github.com/blader/humanizer/blob/main/SKILL.md),
with AuraGo-specific multilingual, factual-integrity, and output-format guidance.
