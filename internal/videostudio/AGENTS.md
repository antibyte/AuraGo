# Video Studio Core Contract

This package owns the Video Studio project model, validation, local media probing,
preview generation, runtime readiness checks, and bounded FFmpeg rendering.

- Inputs passed to FFmpeg are server-staged local regular files. Never accept URLs,
  shell fragments, arbitrary filter expressions, or demuxer names from project data.
- Keep all clip timing in integer frames of the project rate (`ProjectRate`: 24/25/30/50/60 fps, NTSC
  24/30/60 with a 1001 denominator). Convert with `Rate` methods only. Version 1 projects (fixed 30 fps) pass
  through `Upgrade`; `Validate` accepts version 2 only. Projects are limited to sixty minutes and the sizes in
  `CanvasSizes`.
- Bound projects to 8 video, 8 audio and 8 overlay tracks, 2000 clips and 1024 assets. One FFmpeg process uses
  at most `MaxSegmentInputs` (32) inputs. Asset durations are server-owned microseconds (`duration_us`);
  `duration_frames` is derived for the project rate (`AssetAtRate`). Source images/video frames are limited
  to 16,384 pixels per side and 64 megapixels.
- Render through `RenderWithOptions` (`Render` is the whole-timeline wrapper): `PlanVideoSegments` cuts ~10 s
  segments whose boundaries avoid transitions, `PlanAudioSegments` avoids fades, and a segment needing more than
  `MaxSegmentInputs` clips is split. Every clip gets its own `-ss`-seeked input; a clip past the decodable video
  seeks one second before its end and `tpad` holds the last frame. Ranges that start or end inside a transition
  or fade get pre-roll (`expandRange`) and are trimmed back.
- Video segments run with `-copyts -start_at_zero`: video inputs seek about one second early and `fps` samples
  absolute source timestamps, so sources at another rate than the project keep the single pass's cadence in every
  segmentation. A first decoded frame later than the wanted position (video starting after its container) is
  moved back to it. The graph ends in an explicit `scale=...:out_color_matrix=bt709:out_range=tv,format=yuv420p`
  (FFmpeg before 7.1 converts RGBA with BT.601 in the encoder's scaler); hardware uploads append after it.
- Video segments use identical encoder settings (closed GOP, keyframe at frame 0, BT.709 tags) in MPEG-TS; audio
  segments are float PCM WAV with exactly `SampleAt(end)-SampleAt(start)` samples. The final pass uses the
  concat demuxer with explicit durations, `-c:v copy`, one `alimiter` and one AAC encode. Intermediates only
  pass the `concat,mpegts,wav` demuxer allowlist.
- Commands run through `exec.CommandContext` without a shell, one decoder thread per input and four filter
  threads, a four-hour ceiling, bounded diagnostics with scrubbed paths, and `MaxOutputBytes` (default 2 GiB;
  the server passes `max_export_size_mb`); an output that reaches it fails with `ErrOutputLimit` (FFmpeg 8 may
  write past `-fs` on stream copy, so the size check decides). `checkRenderSpace` fails early with `ErrInsufficientDiskSpace`;
  segment failures are `*SegmentError`. Preview proxies are complete-source 540p/30 fps MP4s capped at 512 MiB.
- Preview and export hold the last video frame through longer source audio,
  including clip offsets beyond video EOF; FFmpeg readiness requires `tpad` for
  bounded render padding.
- A transition belongs to its outgoing clip and must equal the explicit overlap
  with the next clip on that same visual track. Other same-track overlaps fail.
  `settb` to the project frame timebase follows every concat and feeds both xfade
  inputs. Only the overlapping frames are premultiplied, cross-faded and
  unpremultiplied (`premultiply`/`unpremultiply`, both required for readiness) so
  a dissolve does not darken picture-in-picture clips; that round trip changes
  pixels even at full opacity, so frames outside a transition never pass through
  it and render identically in every segmentation.
- The server owns persistence, upload staging, job scheduling, and cancellation
  lifecycle. This package stays independent of server state.

Run `go test ./internal/videostudio` for validation, real-frame/audio FFmpeg
integration, and output metadata checks. The opt-in ten-minute local performance
check runs with `AURAGO_VIDEO_STUDIO_BENCHMARK=1 go test ./internal/videostudio
-run '^TestTenMinuteRenderPerformanceOptIn$' -count=1`.
